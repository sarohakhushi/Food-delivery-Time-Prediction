# 🛵 Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project predicts food delivery times based on factors like distance, traffic, weather, and order details. It includes both regression and classification models with detailed visual analysis.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- **EDA & Preprocessing**: Missing value handling, encoding, normalization
- **Visualizations**: Scatter plots, pair plots, boxplots, correlation heatmaps
- **Modeling**:
  - 📈 Linear Regression to predict exact delivery time
  - ✅ Logistic Regression to classify as Fast/Delayed
- **Evaluation**: MSE, MAE, R², Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix, ROC
- **Insights**: Operational recommendations for optimizing delivery performance

## 📁 Deliverables
- Data visualizations & evaluation plots
- Final model report with actionable insights
